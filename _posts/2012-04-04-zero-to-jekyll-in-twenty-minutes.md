Hello everyone,

I posted an article on [Rubysource](http://rubysource.com/zero-to-jekyll-in-20-minutes/).  It's my first time guest blogging, and I'm really excited about it.  In the article I take you through some of the basics of Jekyll.  As you know I recently made the switch to Jekyll for a number of reasons.  In *Zero to Jekyll in Twenty Minutes* you'll get some details about the switch itself rather than just the reasons behind it.

If you have a minute or twenty (...see what I did there? ;) you should hop on over to Rubysource and read the full article.  Also, if you have any questions about the article, Jekyll or just about anything else regarding *Run With It*, feel free to drop me a [line](http://www.jonathan-jackson.net/mail.html).

Happy Coding!
